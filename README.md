# Hello 👋, My Name is Sarahmarie Hollenstein

 I am very creative, I love DIY's, cooking and drawing... So I decided to become a Full Stack Developer! (I always thought programming was all about rules, but my programming friends keep telling me that there is lot of creativity in coding. And they are right!)  Just seeing what HTML, CSS and React can do in real time has made me really excited to learn more. And once I got to the backend, seeing how tables and ER diagrams work just pieced everything together. I am a team player willing to help however I can. And I am really enjoying the journey so far.
