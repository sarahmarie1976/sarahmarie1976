# Hello 👋, My Name is Sarahmarie Hollenstein

 I am very creative, I love DIYs, cooking, and drawing... So I decided to become a Full Stack Developer! (I always thought programming was all about rules, but my programming friends keep telling me that there is a lot of creativity in coding. And they are right!) Just seeing what HTML, CSS and React can do in real-time has made me really excited to learn more. And once I got to the backend, seeing how tables and ER diagrams work just pieced everything together. I am a team player willing to help however I can. And I am really enjoying the journey so far.
