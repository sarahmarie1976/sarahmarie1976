### Hi I'm Sarahmarie! I am very creative, I love DIY, cooking and drawing. So I decided to become a Full Stack Developer. Just seeing what HTML, CSS and React can do in real time made me really excited to learn more. Then when I got to the backend, seeing how to organized tables and creating ER diagrams just pieced everything together.
